## Usage

The average individual uses apps or websites on the daily. Most of these pages require you to sign in to utilize them. Other pages may not require an account, but having an account makes them easier to use. With so many apps, often times having different requirements for what can be used as a password, it can be difficult to come up with unique passwords for each site. The password generator solves this problem. You can select which criteria you need your password to follow, whether that be the password length, if it needs capital and/or lowercase letters, or any special characters. You let the generator know the criteria and at the click of a button it will display your unique password.
